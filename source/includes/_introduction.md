# Introduction

Welcome to Accellion's API Guide.

Accellion’s RESTful Enterprise API is programming language agnostic and enables you to quickly develop apps that leverage the power of the Accellion Platform. Developers can build custom apps tailored to specific industries, business use cases, and integrate them within an existing IT infrastructure. The APIs allow you to do an HTTPS GET, POST, DELETE or UPDATE.
